a Kicked-Out Activist

Welcome to the Truth (Yeah, You Won’t Like It)

If you’re here, you’ve probably heard I got kicked out of Extinction Rebellion. Yeah, that Extinction Rebellion. The group that’s supposed to be at the frontlines of saving the planet, right? Well, buckle up, because I’ve got a lot to say about that.

Why I’m No Longer in XR (Spoiler: They’ve Gone Soft)

Let me just make one thing clear: I didn’t leave XR because I stopped caring about the climate crisis. I was thrown out. Thrown out for being “too extreme.” You heard that right. Too. Extreme. The group that’s supposed to be pushing boundaries, blocking roads, risking arrests... yeah, they’re more concerned about optics than action now.

I guess I wasn’t “civilly disobedient” in the right way. I didn’t fit into their polished, Instagram-friendly activism anymore. It’s all about PR stunts and feel-good protests these days. But tell me this: when the planet is burning and we’ve got just a few decades (if we’re lucky) to stop irreversible damage, do you think smiling for the cameras is going to fix that? No. But apparently, XR does.

What Happened to Real Activism?

When I joined Extinction Rebellion, I thought I was joining a movement that didn’t care about making friends with politicians or appearing “reasonable.” We weren’t here to negotiate. We were here to disrupt. To make the people in power uncomfortable, to force change.

But now? They’ve turned into performers. It’s all symbolic gestures with zero bite. Block a road for two hours, wave some banners, then pat yourself on the back like you’ve changed the world. Here’s a hint: you haven’t. You’ve just delayed traffic. Congratulations.

Meanwhile, the climate crisis is getting worse every single day, but what are we doing? Arguing over how we’re perceived. Oh, don’t be too loud, Troy! Don’t make too much of a scene! We don’t want to alienate people! Sorry, but do you think the fossil fuel companies are “worried about alienating people” when they’re funding politicians and wrecking ecosystems? No, they’re laughing all the way to the bank while we bicker about being polite.

The Baku Climate Meeting 2024: A Grim Joke

Let’s talk about the latest farce – the Baku Climate Meeting 2024. Another one of these massive, high-stakes summits where global leaders gather, spew empty promises, and pat each other on the back for “doing their part” while the world literally burns. If you think anything meaningful is going to come out of Baku, let me burst your bubble: it’s going to be business as usual.

Just look at the lead-up. World leaders are already lining up to lower expectations, preparing their excuses for why “progress is slow,” why “compromises had to be made.” Compromises with whom? The very industries poisoning the planet. Oil lobbyists, coal executives, corporate interests – they’re all there, mingling with the same politicians pretending to save the Earth. It’s like inviting the arsonists to help rebuild the house they just set on fire. And the public? The people who actually want real change? We’re left out in the cold, again.

Let me ask you, how many summits do we need before it’s too late? Baku is just another distraction, another glossy event with carefully controlled narratives so that leaders can go home and say, “Hey, look at us, we care.” Meanwhile, sea levels are rising, the Arctic is melting, and the Amazon is burning. They don’t care. If they did, they’d be acting—and by acting, I mean shutting down the fossil fuel industry, not giving them more seats at the table.

What’s Really Happening in Baku?

And you know what really creeps me out about Baku 2024? It feels different. It’s not just another toothless climate conference—it’s a shift. Behind closed doors, they’re not planning how to save the planet. They’re planning how to survive it. The climate talks have stopped being about prevention and are now about preparation—preparing the elites, the wealthy, and the powerful to weather the chaos they know is coming.

While they smile for the cameras and draft their “agreements,” they’re simultaneously securing their luxury bunkers, figuring out how to control food supplies, water, and energy in a world that’s falling apart. It’s disaster capitalism at its finest: let the planet burn, but make sure you’re still in charge when the ashes settle.

Baku isn’t about fixing the crisis—it’s about managing the collapse. And that should scare you.

I’m Done Playing Nice

Let me be crystal clear: I didn’t sign up for some performative nonsense. I signed up to fight for this planet, even if it means making people uncomfortable. And if that’s “too extreme,” well, I guess I’m too extreme. But you know what? The planet needs extremists. It needs people willing to throw themselves in front of machines, who aren’t afraid to be hated, who aren’t afraid to break a few rules when the system is rigged against them.

I’m not here to convince you that the planet is in trouble. If you don’t already know that, you’re part of the problem. I’m here to tell you that politeness and polished activism are the enemy right now. We don’t need more fancy slogans and symbolic arrests for social media. We need real resistance. And guess what? That gets messy. It pisses people off. Good.

What’s Next?

Am I done? No. Not even close. I might be out of Extinction Rebellion, but that just means I’m free. I don’t have to play by their rules anymore. I don’t have to “tone it down” or “strategize” how I look in the media.

If you’re still reading this and you actually care, I’m organizing. Real actions. Not this corporate-friendly, watered-down crap XR is serving. We’re talking direct action with no apologies. I’m building a community of people who aren’t afraid to disrupt, to sacrifice, and to actually do something that matters.

So, if you’re tired of the performative activism, if you’re angry—really angry—at the way things are going, reach out. We’re not here to play games. We’re here to fight for the survival of the planet.

And to Extinction Rebellion: thanks for showing your true colors. You’ve become part of the very system you were supposed to challenge. I’ll be over here, actually doing something about it.

Want to Join the Fight?

Drop your details below if you’re ready to get serious about saving this planet. This isn’t a game, and if you’re looking for safe, convenient activism, this isn’t for you. But if you’re ready to make a real impact, you know where to find me.

Disclaimer: This is not about cozying up to anyone. This is not about building alliances with people who profit from the destruction of our world. This is about action, not optics.

Yours truly,
Sigm4earth.
